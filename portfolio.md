# Portfolio

## Blogs

My blogs are the center of my public writing:

- https://appliedgo.net and 
- https://appliedgo.com/blog. 

## Newsletter

I run a weekly newsletter on Go. Once I found a suitable way of maintaining an archive of past issues (my current mailing provider has no such option), I'll post it here.

## Course content

You can watch and read lectures from my Go course at https://appliedgo.com/courses/mastergo. This is a course bundle with two courses inside. Click each course, scroll down to the curriculum where you'll find previews of some of the lectures.
